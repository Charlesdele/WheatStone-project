This project aims to recreate the pixel and bitmap librairies of C# from scratch and implement them in multiple ways.
The name of the project was inspired from Charles Wheatstone with his invention of the stereogram, which we implemented in the form of autostereogram generation in the project.

## Set up

When running the code for the first time, choose the image you want to work on.
A few ones are already in an image folder like the parot (coco), the eagle (lac) and the girl (lea).

If you want to use your images put them in the folder **images_de_base** at the following path : _ProjectWheatstone/bin/Debug/images_de_base_

Be careful you have to use bitmap images. You'll find the images you will modify in the folder **images** (in the Debug)
